📊 Sport England Participation Insights Dashboard
Built with Power BI | By Neeraj Raj Srinivasa Raju

This project presents a complete analytical dashboard built using Sport England’s Active Lives Survey (2019–20 & 2020–21).
The dashboard uncovers participation trends, demographic patterns, and regional variations to support data-driven decisions in sport development and policy planning.

Built with a star-schema data model, optimised DAX, a custom UI theme, and intuitive navigation, this dashboard is designed for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

🧠 Project Description

The Active Lives Survey provides insight into how people across England engage in sports and physical activities.
This Power BI report transforms raw data into an interactive insight tool with:

Year-on-year trend analysis

Demographic segmentation (age, gender, disability)

Local authority and regional participation patterns

National vs area comparisons

Insightful treemaps, maps, KPIs, and slicer-driven interactions

Advanced DAX (CALCULATE, DIVIDE, SUMX, FILTER, SELECTEDVALUE, SWITCH) were used for all KPIs and interactive calculations.
